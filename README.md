Teaching English Language Learners Across the Content Areas by Judie Haynes,Debbie Zacarian Book Review

Name: ELLteacher
Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Very useful, great for an inquiry group
Date: Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 16, 2010
Review: I read most of this book while sitting on a beach in Maine one weekend. That doesn't mean it's a typical summer beach read. (It's not as fun or steamy as the ones I grab from the new fiction shelf at the library.) I did, however, find it very well written with a concise, accessible style. I've worked with English learners for 20 years and have tried to keep current on recent research through graduate classes, workshops, and independent study. This book presents the latest research and offers strategies for all grade levels. It encourages teachers to know their students, to differentiate instruction, and to plan for multiple ways that students can show what they have learned. The authors are not preachy. They understand that differentiating instruction for English learners is challenging and requires collaboration with peers and support from administration. I will facilitate an inquiry group at my school this year, and this is the text we will read and discuss. I look forward to the conversations this book will generate!

Title: Basic but good info

Review: This book covers the basics, but has very helpful ideas and practical strategies. It's a great refresher for the EL classroom or would be great for a mainstream teacher to read.

Title: valuable resource
Date: Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 15, 2012
Review: I am a high school ELD teacher, EL coordinator, and head of the EL department. I have been looking for something to assist our EL teachers across all content areas since our district can't afford prof. dev. due to budge cuts. This book is excellent. I must have for all EL teachers even those that have been in the field as long as I have. One should never stop trying to improve and this offers specific strategies and lessons on how each was used to give a better idea on how to apply it in your classroom.

Date: Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 1, 2015
Review: The work is intended for ESOL educators, classroom teachers, and administrators. It highlights practical points that can be utilized in the field posthaste. As well, it identifies and, based on the authors' research, debunks commonly-held viewpoints concerning ESOL instruction. What with the changing demographics currently in U.S. schools, the work is highly necessary, particularly in schools where English Language Learners are instructed at any level of proficiency.
